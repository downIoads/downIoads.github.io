      <title>Encrypt data using Argon2 and AES-GCM-256 in Python</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have bought insecure Mifare Classic 1k cards (Crypto-1 is broken and should not be used), so the only way to securely store data on these cards is with a tamperproof, modern encryption algorithm. So I decided to learn some basics and write a simple Python script that allows me to do this. AES-GCM was chosen because it features tags that are used to determine whether encrypted data was tempered with or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to authenticate and write data to Mifare Classic 1k using ACS ACR122U</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal&#34;&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I bought some Mifare Classic 1k tags and all Android/iOS apps I tried (official NXP apps, NFC Tools Pro and Mifare Classic Tool) failed to write data to my tags! Mifare Classic tags are not as straight-forward as e.g. NTAG ones because they are proprietary (they do technically support NDEF, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a compatible as you would like it to be). So to write data to these tags using my ACS ACR122U, I use the Windows Smart Card API to communicate with the NFC reader. Then I use special commands to authenticate the block I want to write data to, and then the data is written. I also added a function to NDEF format the entire card so that it becomes compatible with iOS and Android apps!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-nfc-tags&#34;&gt;Overview of NFC tags&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NFC was invented in 2002 by Sony and NXP Semiconductors. Since then, a lot of different standards and tags have been created, so here is a basic overview of commonly used tags and their classification. To simplify things, commonly used NFC tags can usually be put into one of five forum types:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forum type 1 (read-only)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forum type 2 (usually read/write and more storage than type 1)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forum type 3 (mainly used in Japan)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forum type 4 (like type 2, but with more storage and features and a higher cost than type 2)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Forum type 5 (highest communication range, not commonly used by consumers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These forum types help cluster different tags into categories. Different manufacturers produce different chip series, but the most commonly used and best supported NFC tags are the NTAG series by NXP. If you just want to play around with NFC and want to buy the most compatible (e.g., with smartphones) NFC tags, you should purchase NTAG 2xx or NTAG 4xx tags. To provide a broader overview, here is an overview of the arguably most popular and most compatible NFC tag series called NTAG by NXP:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
