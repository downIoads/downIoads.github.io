      <description>Introduction I have bought insecure Mifare Classic 1k cards (Crypto-1 is broken and should not be used), so the only way to securely store data on these cards is with a tamperproof, modern encryption algorithm. So I decided to learn some basics and write a simple Python script that allows me to do this. AES-GCM was chosen because it features tags that are used to determine whether encrypted data was tempered with or not.</description>
