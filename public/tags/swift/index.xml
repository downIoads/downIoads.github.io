      <description>Introduction Yt-dlp and ffmpeg and two of my favorite command-line tools. But I keep having to look up how to use them! For this reason, I made a simple SwiftUI GUI that has three simple commands built-in. The user only has to choose and output folder and a file type (mp3 [audio only], opus [audio only] and mkv [audio and video]) and click the download button. The binaries for yt-dlp and ffmpeg are downloaded from the most official sources I could find at runtime.</description>
