      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have played around a bit with the new Llama 2 LLM, more specifically with the 13B parameter Huggingface version that you can download &lt;a href=&#34;https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In order to run it, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp&#34;&gt;Llama.cpp&lt;/a&gt;. It has precise setup instructions, so I will assume you get that running on your own. What I did not enjoy was having to type long commands into my Windows cmd every time, so I decided to write a short Python script that runs the process in the background and displays the output in the Python shell in real-time (well, almost). Windows paths are weird, especially when you try to put them in a Python string. Double-escaping \ did not seem to work, so I had to go with raw strings instead. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the script I am using:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
