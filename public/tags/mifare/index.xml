      <description>Introduction I have bought insecure Mifare Classic 1k cards (Crypto-1 is broken and should not be used), so the only way to securely store data on these cards is with a tamperproof, modern encryption algorithm. So I decided to learn some basics and write a simple Python script that allows me to do this. AES-GCM was chosen because it features tags that are used to determine whether encrypted data was tempered with or not.</description>

      <description>Goal I bought some Mifare Classic 1k tags and all Android/iOS apps I tried (official NXP apps, NFC Tools Pro and Mifare Classic Tool) failed to write data to my tags! Mifare Classic tags are not as straight-forward as e.g. NTAG ones because they are proprietary (they do technically support NDEF, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a compatible as you would like it to be). So to write data to these tags using my ACS ACR122U, I use the Windows Smart Card API to communicate with the NFC reader.</description>
