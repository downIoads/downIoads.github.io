      <description>Introduction When you run local servers on your Raspberry Pi you by default only get unencrypted http communications which makes it trivial for anyone in your LAN to snoop the traffic. This post is a brief tutorial how to get free encrypted https communcations without having to purchase a real domain name. I use the example of a self-hosted Gitlab server as this was my actual use-case, but this tutorial should be useful even if you do not care about the Gitlab part.</description>

      <title>Automated self-hosted GitLab backups to Dropbox using a Python script on Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>Introduction I prefer self-hosted GitLab over uploading my code to GitHub. The only disadvantage is that I need to take care of backups myself in case a hard drive dies or gets stolen. Therefore, I wrote a simple Python script that runs on my Raspberry Pi twice a week, which backs up my GitLab config and data and uploads them to my Dropbox. Specifically, I am using the free community edition of GitLab on my RPI.</description>
